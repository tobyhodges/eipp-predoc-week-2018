In some cases we can stream our courses for you to follow online but often you would need to travel to Heidelberg to attend. We try to give as much advanced notice of our courses as possible, so that those from other stations can make plans to attend. In the past, we have also traveled to other stations (Rome & Grenoble so far) in cases where there is sufficient demand for a specific course. Feel free to chat to me/send me an email if you would like to discuss any of this further."
