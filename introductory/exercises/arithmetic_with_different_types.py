# Which of the following will print 2.0?
# Note: there may be more than one right answer.

first = 1.0
second = "1"
third = "1.1"

#     1. first + float(second)
#     2. float(second) + float(third)
#     3. first + int(third)
#     4. first + int(float(third))
#     5. int(first) + int(float(third))
#     6. 2.0 * second
