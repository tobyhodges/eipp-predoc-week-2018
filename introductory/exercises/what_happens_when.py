# 1. Explain in simple terms the order of operations in the following program:
# when does the addition happen, when does the subtraction happen, when is each function called, etc.
# 2. What is the final value of radiance?

radiance = 1.0
radiance = max(2.1, 2.0 + min(radiance, 1.1 * radiance - 0.5))
